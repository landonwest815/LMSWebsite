The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was that there are many, many ways to get your Javascript to work. You can use classes, selectors, and all sorts of methods to get, change, and update various elements in your html. It all depends on how you set it up.

The hardest thing in this assignment was understanding the new Javascript syntax.

It was also tricky to work on the sorting and making sure they sorted in the correct orders.
