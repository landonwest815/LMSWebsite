- N/A

[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how linear the html layout feels. With the separation of CSS, it makes HTML feel like we are simply listing out the functionality of our webpages in a top to bottom order. There is no horizontal building (besides maybe the table rows i guess), and you don't really get to see how each tag appears on the page until you reload in the browser.

The hardest thing in this assignment was not being able to spend time on changing the look of the elements. I love the design part of Computer Science and having to spend practially 100% of this assignment just setting up the functionality and structure of this assignment was pretty tricky. It was weird to see elements show up in a much different layout than the images provided as it made me unsure on if I was doing things right.
