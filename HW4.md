The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how we are now able to literally upload any sort of file and have it be downloadable from the website. It just worked once I followed the instructions and that's pretty cool.

The hardest thing in this assignment was making sure that all the errors were caught correctly. My browser was doing its own thing to try and catch error and this didn't even allow me to test out invalid inputs during development. I found that removing the input type temporarily helped with this issue.
