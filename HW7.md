[x] I solemnly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was the idea of having to copy over the entire folder of work this semester over to some computer in Ohio. It's cool to think that all our code is now running continuously over there, and we don't have to worry about keeping it running on our own local machines. 

The hardest thing in this assignment was following the instructions very carefully. It was easy to get mixed up by simply missing a certain piece of code in the terminal commands. Making sure to change copy and paste code from the Github instructions to our own personal IPs or Hostnames was tricky to stay on top of.
