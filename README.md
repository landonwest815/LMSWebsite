# Web Server Project (Django)

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive, Django-based web server that reflects the foundational principles and advanced concepts introduced during the course. It integrates front-end and back-end development practices, data modeling, user management, and deployment strategies. By studying and exploring this codebase, you’ll gain insight into how these topics fit together to create a functional, scalable, and secure web application.

## Key Topics and Concepts Covered

### Front-End Foundations (HTML & CSS)
- **Semantic HTML Structure:**  
  Utilizing semantic elements for accessible, maintainable layouts.
- **Styling with CSS:**  
  Applying external stylesheets, mastering the box model, and employing responsive design principles.
- **Django Templates:**  
  Leveraging Django’s templating engine for dynamic content, reusable layouts, and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) patterns.

### Backend Architecture (Models & Views)
- **Django Models:**  
  Structuring relational data using Django’s ORM, defining models for Users, TAs, and Admin roles.
- **Views & URL Routing:**  
  Implementing function-based or class-based views, mapping URLs in `urls.py`, and maintaining logical app structure.
- **Django Admin Site:**  
  Taking advantage of Django’s built-in admin interface for inspecting and managing data.

### Forms & Controllers
- **Django Forms:**  
  Creating and processing forms on the server, validating input, and integrating form data with models.
- **Controllers (View Logic):**  
  Connecting models, forms, and templates to handle requests and return appropriate responses.
- **Security & Validation:**  
  Protecting against CSRF attacks, sanitizing input, and ensuring robust form validation.

### User Management & Permissions
- **Authentication System:**  
  Implementing user login, logout, password management, and session handling.
- **Role-Based Permissions:**  
  Differentiating functionality for Users, TAs, and Admins, and restricting access to sensitive operations.
- **Session Management:**  
  Utilizing cookies and sessions to maintain user state and preferences.

### JavaScript & Client-Side Interactivity
- **Dynamic Content Updates:**  
  Using JavaScript for asynchronous requests (AJAX), form enhancements, and DOM manipulations.
- **Frontend Performance & Structure:**  
  Organizing scripts and optimizing front-end code for better performance and maintainability.

### Deployment & AWS
- **Production-Ready Configuration:**  
  Adjusting Django settings for production, handling static files, and enforcing security best practices.
- **AWS Integration:**  
  Deploying the Django application to Amazon Web Services, setting up hosting, domains, load balancing, and scaling.
