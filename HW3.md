[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how each different file in this Django setup does its own thing. They all link together to give us our awesome, working website. Having everything separated with purpose makes it a little easier to not get lost in the code.

The hardest thing in this assignment was the process of getting all these seperate files linked up. I ran into many errors that related to super specific syntax or lines that I wasn't familiar with. Getting it connected was difficult, but once it was things were much smoother.
